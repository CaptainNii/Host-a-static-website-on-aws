📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to host a static HTML website on AWS using a secure, scalable, and fault-tolerant architecture.

It covers:

🏗 Building a multi-AZ AWS network infrastructure

⚙ Deploying EC2 instances in private subnets with an Application Load Balancer

🌍 Configuring Route 53 & HTTPS via AWS Certificate Manager

📢 Setting up SNS notifications for Auto Scaling events

# Host a Static Website on AWS

## 🛠 AWS Architecture

1. **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** with public and private subnets across two Availability Zones.
2. **Internet Gateway** for connectivity between the VPC and the internet.
3. **Security Groups** to control inbound and outbound traffic.
4. **Multi-AZ Setup** for high availability and fault tolerance.
5. **Public Subnets** for NAT Gateway and Application Load Balancer.
6. **EC2 Instance Connect Endpoint** for secure access to resources in both public and private subnets.
7. **Private Subnets** hosting EC2 instances for enhanced security.
8. **NAT Gateway** to allow instances in private subnets to access the internet.
9. **EC2 Instances** running the website.
10. **Application Load Balancer** with a target group to distribute web traffic evenly.
11. **Auto Scaling Group** to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances.
12. **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.
13. **AWS Certificate Manager** for securing communication.
14. **Amazon SNS** for Auto Scaling activity alerts.
15. **Route 53** for domain registration and DNS configuration.

## 🚀 Deployment Script

The project includes a `bash` script for automating the EC2 instance setup:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo su
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
cd /var/www/html
yum install -y git
git clone https://github.com/aosnotes77/host-a-static-website-on-aws.git
cp -R host-a-static-website-on-aws/. /var/www/html/
rm -rf host-a-static-website-on-aws
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd
```

## 📧 Notifications

SNS is configured to send alerts about Auto Scaling activities. Ensure that your subscription is active to receive notifications.

## 🔐 Security

* All web traffic is secured with **HTTPS** via AWS Certificate Manager.
* Web servers are placed in private subnets, accessible only through the load balancer.
